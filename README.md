# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

## Overview

This project incorporates Server-Sent Events (SSE), a straightforward and effective method for real-time communication between the server and clients. SSE allows the server to push updates to the web browser over a single HTTP connection, making it ideal for applications requiring instant updates.

## What is Server-Sent Events (SSE)

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a web technology that enables servers to push updates to web clients over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. This lightweight mechanism eliminates the need for constant client requests, providing a simple and efficient way to transmit real-time updates.

### Key Features:

- **Simplicity**: SSE is easy to implement and use.
- **Real-time Updates**: Enables the server to send real-time updates to clients.
- **Connection Resilience**: Automatically reconnects if the connection is lost.
